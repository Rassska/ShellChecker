### Description
**This console app automated students' bash scripts testing some routine bash scripts like "Calculating" that saved about 10 minutes per student's task review.**

In our university Operating Systems course we have to create an app that's supporting some proporties like: "Calculating", "Finding files", "Reversing data" and so on... So, I mention that teacher waste a lot of time for testing Calculating and I have decision to create a simple console tester which can test all Calculating script for the few seconds

### How it is working?
