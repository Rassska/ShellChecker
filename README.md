# ShellChecker

### Description
**This console app automated students' bash scripts testing some routine bash scripts like "Calculating" that saved about 10 minutes per student's task review.**

In our university Operating Systems course we have to create an app that's supporting some proporties like: "Calculating", "Finding files", "Reversing data" and so on... So, I mention that teacher waste a lot of time for testing Calculating and I have decision to create a simple console tester which can test all Calculating script for the few seconds

Can be compiled with any `C++14` and up compliant compiler

### How it is working?
_It's easy to manage with_

***So, in _*main.sh_ you have to set path to the calculating script.***

***So, after that we can run our console app and we get something like this:***

**As you can see, all corner cases have tested and at the same time we can check the reason of the cases which was falled. The file _*error.txt_ has this information**
__For the current *exp1.sh *error.txt looks like:__

_That's it, I hope you enjoy this app and thanks for your attention!_
